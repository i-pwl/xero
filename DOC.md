# xero - unparalleled homescreen customization

This is the documentation for the xero project. xero is a tool that allows homescreen "layouts" to be created via JSON files, and extended functionality by allowing commands to be executed by a defined action. These commands could even be shell scripts to run a multitude of actions at once! 

Shell scripts where chosen because they are very versitile, with small command line utilities being able to do things such as open apps, or even set the volume and brightness on the device. How ever we must talk about the basic JSON layout tools, first.
